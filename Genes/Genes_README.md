Predicted transcript and protein sequences from the F-locus region in QTL parent clones Xinb3 (files beginning with "xF") and Iinb1 (files beginning with "iF"). Sequence predictions are based on the (handcurated) structural gene annotations (assembled and annotated haplotypes are available on GenBank at accession numbers OP831933 and OP831934; see also S6_File in manuscript), but Iinb1 genes 2591, 2592, and 2593 have been additionally corrected based on Sanger sequencing data (available on GenBank at accession numbers OP795832-OP795834, and see S9_Figure in manuscript). See Figure 3 in manuscript for functional gene annotations and relative position of each gene in the F-locus region.
